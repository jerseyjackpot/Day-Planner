# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
```
Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The page uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
